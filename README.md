# SET
Welcome to SET! In this exciting C++ endeavor, we bring the engaging SET card game to life. 
Whether you're a seasoned SET strategist or a newcomer to the game, our implementation promises a captivating experience. Read on to discover the world of patterns, graphics, and fun!

## Summary
This C++ project implements the SET card game, a pattern recognition card game where players find sets of cards with matching or distinct features.

## Program Overview
The program utilizes the following concepts:
- Graphics
- Texturing
- Shaders
- Logic at the speed of rendering

## Operating System Compatibility
The project can theoretically run on any OS, but has only been tested on Windows and Ubuntu.
